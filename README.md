# Frontend Presence App - Material UI & Vite.js

## Overview

This project is a frontend application designed for managing presence and various administrative tasks within an internal system. The project is built using **Vite.js** for fast development and build processes, and **Material UI** for a rich and responsive user interface. The application is modular, with clearly separated concerns for different features such as attendance tracking, employee management, and more.

### Key Features:
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different dashboards and sidebars for Admin and Superadmin users.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Handles navigation and access control based on user roles and authentication status.
- **Form Handling**: Utilizes `react-hook-form` and `Yup` for form validation and management.
- **State Management**: Manages global state using Redux, making it easier to handle complex state logic across the app.

## How to Use

To start using the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.cloudias79.com/internal-apps/presence-app/frontend-presence-app.git
cd frontend-presence-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## The Idea Behind the Project

This project leverages **Vite.js** for fast builds and hot module replacement (HMR), making the development process quick and efficient. **Material UI** is used to provide a consistent, modern, and responsive user interface. By integrating Redux for state management, the application is able to manage complex state logic, while `react-hook-form` ensures that form handling is robust and easy to maintain.

## What's Next?

Now that you have a working frontend application, you can further develop it by:

- Integrating with backend services for data persistence and business logic.
- Expanding the UI/UX to meet the needs of your users.
- Implementing additional features such as reporting, notifications, and more.

For more detailed guidance, refer to the [Material UI documentation](https://mui.com/) and the [Vite.js documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).
